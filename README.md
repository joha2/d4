## Higher dimensional geometry

* How to define it? (Mathematical description of spheres, cylinders, cubes, ...)
* How to save it? (Triangle based format after surface triangulation, higher dimensional generalization of STL)
* How to draw it? 
	- Projection based: local coordinate system defines a w = 0 plane 
	- which slices the higher dimensional geometry
	- these cutted higher dimensional geometry is 3D but maybe not simply connected anymore
