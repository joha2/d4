## Higher dimensional geometry

* How to define it? (Mathematical description of spheres, cylinders, cubes, ...)
	- Boolean operations
	- Simple Mathematical bodies
	- f(x, y, z, w) = 0
* How to save it? (Triangle based format after surface triangulation, higher dimensional generalization of STL)
	- In n dimensions: boundary n-1 dimensional; This means from 3-dim boundary generation of 4-dim mesh
* How to draw it? 
	- Projection based: local coordinate system defines a w = 0 plane 
	- which slices the higher dimensional geometry
	- these cutted higher dimensional geometry is 3D but maybe not simply connected anymore
	- mesh of 4d tets: slicing of 4d tet sub problem but solvable
